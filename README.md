Website set-up for integration of Sphinx with my streaming business

Hi there! I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to share that I am in the process of creating a website for my streaming business, which already serves over 85+ customers. I am passionate about creating a user-friendly interface and am looking for a partner who shares this vision. Together, we can build a website that is easy to use and doesn't require any personal information or emails for sign-up, similar to Sphinx.

I envision customers being able to select the products they want to purchase and make payments in sats or credit, similar to the 'get started' section on Sphinx where one pays for a node. That's why I am also looking for a partner who can provide nodes on Sphinx, in return they will receive payments from my customers and issuing the customers with nodes loaded with sats for purchase on Sphinx.

On my end, I will send paid messages to my clients with the login information for the services they have purchased. If you're interested in joining me on this exciting journey, please feel free to reach out to me via email at [wellivhimura@duck.com](mailto:wellivhimura@duck.com) or on Sphinx via the following key: 0282a7820770e3184a40fb98d752b2eadeebe3db9b7cb67c2df9ff201f591088e4. Let's bring this vision to life together!
